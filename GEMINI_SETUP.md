4. **COPY** the API key (starts with `AIza...`)

### Step 2: Add to Your App
1. Open `/workspace/techstackr/.env`
2. Find the line: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here`

```bash
bin/rails runner "
  user = User.first || User.create!(username: 'testuser', password: 'password123', password_confirmation: 'password123')

    description: 'A modern online store with real-time inventory and personalized recommendations',
    project_type: 'web_application',

## Free Tier Limits

| Feature | Free Tier |

| Requests per minute (RPM) | 15 |
| Requests per day | 1,500 |

For your TechStackr app, this means:

## Models Available

Your app uses **Gemini 1.5 Flash** which is:
- Fast (optimized for low latency)
- FREE
- Great for structured outputs like JSON
- Context window: 1M tokens

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "API key not configured"
- Make sure you added the key to `.env`
- Restart your Rails server: `bin/dev`
- Verify the key starts with `AIza`

### Error: "API key not valid"
- Double-check you copied the full key
- Make sure there are no extra spaces
- Try generating a new key in Google AI Studio

### Error: "Quota exceeded"
- Free tier: 1,500 requests/day
- Wait until tomorrow or upgrade (still very cheap)
- Check your usage: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

## What Happened to Hugging Face?

We tried Hugging Face extensively but encountered issues:
- Most free models aren't deployed on inference providers
- Models return 404 errors even with valid API tokens
- The free Serverless Inference API appears to be restricted
- Would require paid Inference Endpoints ($0.06/hour minimum)

Gemini is a better choice for free, reliable AI!

## Next Steps

After testing locally:
1. Your app will generate awesome tech recommendations!
2. The UI already works - just add your API key
3. Consider the paid tier only if you need 1,500+ requests/day

Enjoy your free AI-powered tech recommendations! üéâ
